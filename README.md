# Hackathon-Munich
Early May, we will host a hackathon with the theme: Come hoam and make it smart. (For all not-yet-Munich-fans: ‘hoam’ means ‘home’ in the Bavarian dialect.) We offer a scene, where creative minds like you, can burst into bloom around the things that make our lives more efficient. Welcome use this repository when checking in your code.

## Who can participate?

Everybody who can code and is interested in the topic is welcome to join, regardless if it is the first time or not.  Please note that you have to be over 18 years old to participate.

## Teams

Teams can be anywhere from three to five members. You will be able to find your team at the first get2gether. Here you’ll have the time to listen to everyone’s ideas, pitch your own and get to know each other in a relaxed, yet exciting atmosphere.

## Code, Design, SFX, Music, etc.

To ensure a level field for all contestants, all code, design, art, music, SFX, and assets must be created during the duration of the Hackathon. We want to ensure that all participants start off with the same chances and also want to preserve the true nature of a hackathon. You are, however, free to make plans and brainstorm prior to the event. Of course you can use material that is freely available to the public. Some examples of this would be: public domain images, creative commons music, open source libraries. But this is it. We take this rule very seriously for the sake of all members attending the event. Failure to comply may result in the offending team’s disqualification.

## Submitting your code

Use Github, and this repository: [Hackathon Munich](https://github.com/hackathonAW/Hackathon-Munich) when submitting your code. 

Welcome to use the Hackathon Munich repository to store and share your code. Use your personal [github](https://github.com/) account - create one if you don't have one - and use the fork button found in the top right corner of the [repository page](https://github.com/hackathonAW/Hackathon-Munich) to create your own copy of the repository. 

## Ownership

All teams retain full ownership of what they have created during the Hackathon. Academic Work is here to help young professionals realize their dreams, not to destroy them.
