# Hackathon-Munich
Early May, we will host a hackathon with the theme: Come hoam and make it smart. (For all not-yet-Munich-fans: ‘hoam’ means ‘home’ in the Bavarian dialect.) We offer a scene, where creative minds like you, can burst into bloom around the things that make our lives more efficient. Welcome use this repository when checking in your code.
